# Breaking changes:
#    feat!: <subject>  (breaking change - note the !)
#    Or add "BREAKING CHANGE: description" in the footer
#
# IMPORTANT: All commits must include a DCO sign-off:
#    Use: git commit -s
#    This adds: Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
#    build    (changes to build system or dependencies)
# --------------------
# Remember to:
#   - Use the imperative mood in the subject line
#   - Do not end the subject line with a period
#   - Separate subject from body with a blank line
#   - Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
#   - Can use multiple lines with "-" for bullet points in body
# --------------------
# For breaking changes, add ! after type or include BREAKING CHANGE: in footer
# Example:
#   feat!: remove deprecated API endpoint
#
#   BREAKING CHANGE: The /api/v1/legacy endpoint has been removed.
