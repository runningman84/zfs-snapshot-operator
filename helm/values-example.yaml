# Example values file for ZFS Snapshot Operator
# This file demonstrates how to customize snapshot retention settings

# Operator configuration
# For Kubernetes deployments, use chroot mode (default)
operator:
  mode: chroot
  chrootHostPath: /host
  chrootBinPath: /usr/local/sbin

# Snapshot retention configuration
# Adjust these values based on your backup retention requirements
snapshots:
  # Keep 48 hours worth of hourly snapshots (2 days)
  maxHourly: 48

  # Keep 14 days worth of daily snapshots (2 weeks)
  maxDaily: 14

  # Keep 8 weeks worth of weekly snapshots (2 months)
  maxWeekly: 8

  # Keep 24 months worth of monthly snapshots (2 years)
  maxMonthly: 24

  # Keep 5 years worth of yearly snapshots
  maxYearly: 5

# Pool filtering
# Specify which pools to manage snapshots for
pools:
  # Comma-separated list of pool names
  # Example: "tank,backup" to only manage tank and backup pools
  # Leave empty to manage all pools
  whitelist: "tank,backup"

# CronJob configuration
cronjob:
  # Run every hour
  schedule: "0 * * * *"

  # Run every 15 minutes for more frequent snapshots
  # schedule: "*/15 * * * *"

  # Run daily at 2 AM
  # schedule: "0 2 * * *"
